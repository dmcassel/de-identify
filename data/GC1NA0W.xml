Be aware of your surroundings... especially the office building windows close by.  We wouldn't want a sick muggle retrieving our container and using it as a barf bucket!

Tyler, our 9-year-old son, came up with the clever name for the cache so we have dedicated this hide to him.  

Good luck and have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>
