Stealth may be required. 
Container can be removed to take inside your car for opening, logging and sealing if additional stealth is needed. 
Please return  to exact spot.
No pen or pencil provided. 
Use common sense when crossing the lot...it is sometimes very busy with cars and people coming and going; then 10 minutes later it'll be deserted.

Hints will be posted when needed. I think novice and seasoned players should have no difficulty to find it.

Enjoy!
