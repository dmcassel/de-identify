      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Sikorsky Sky Hook is a large, cargo carrying helicopter that's known for getting  into places that are very difficult. They're mostly used in logging and construction operations.
Please unscrew the cache container from the cache holder.
There's a small prize for FTF.
Parking is nearby off Norwood Rd. I recommend you park in the pull-off area facing south on Norwood. If you're coming north on Norwood, you can turn around just past the GZ at Sterling Lane and come back. It's much easier to pull back into traffic from the southbound side of Norwood than from the northbound side.

Congrats to gohangasalami for the FTF! [:D]</groundspeak:long_description>
