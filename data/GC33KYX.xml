      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Kerr Park is a 45-acre municipal park adjacent to the Brandywine Creek. Centrally located in the Borough of Downingtown, it offers facilities for sports and community events. The park includes picnic pavilions, public restrooms, a trout hatchery and the “Sky’s the Limit Playground”. The cache is located just off the white blazed Brandywine Trail which runs along the Brandywine Creek. 

Be careful and have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>
