      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hide another one in (almost) the same spot of course!!!!!

It seems I don't get out to cache as much as I should (must be busy with hiding caches, I guess)and I missed that this one was gone.

No matter, I turned this DNF into another one in my hides column.

Good luck and use the handy pull off to park!

Congrats to The GeoBunch for the FTF honors (their first)!!!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
