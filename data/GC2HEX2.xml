      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache cache was designed with the workers of the NBP in mind, to give those cacher's who stare out their windows at lunch a reason to get out of the office and get some fresh air! Though all cacher's are welcome....

Watch out for the hotel staff as they bumble around the parking lot chasing squirrels and other related activities......

Cache contains two new AA batteries to any forlorn cacher in trouble, and a pen for logging. 

Please replace as found, room inside to leave items.

CONGRATS to Cycleangela on the FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
