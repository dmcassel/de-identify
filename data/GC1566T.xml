      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in the Carpenter Area of White Clay Creek
State Park, that is reached from Rt 896. From May to October this
is a fee area. (Better yet get an annual pass to Delaware State
parks)
&lt;p&gt;It was released at the same time as the Dog Days of Summer
Picnic geocaching event in the park hosted by WhiteClayLover that I
have called "Wendy's Picnic".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo medium tupperware cantainer located in the
Fitness trail section of the park that is generally sticker free.
Ther are many trails to the cache (none direct) so look at the park
map. At one time there was a cache in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The cache contains an unactivated travel bug tag provided by
WhiteClayLover as a FTF&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
