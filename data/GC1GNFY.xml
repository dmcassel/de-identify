      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Since my original Go Sit in the Corner had to be archived, I found another spot to place a similar hide.  This one is not likely to be destroyed like the last one was.  Parking near the cache or across the street in the park.  Please use stealth, especially when there are people near the building or over in the park.</groundspeak:long_description>
