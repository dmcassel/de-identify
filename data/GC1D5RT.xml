      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a micro container located near the roadway of Old Valley Road, which is a lovely little gravel road not far off of Ship Road. Take your time driving in, there are some big puddles after a rainfall, and ruts - hence the name.
Please place cache in precisely the same location you found it.
Sorry no hints.</groundspeak:long_description>
