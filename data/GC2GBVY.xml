We thought this would be a cool place to hide a cache, especially this close to Halloween. 








We do not recommend going at night. It will be extremely difficult. Plus, it will give you the creeps! 

Also, we forgot a pen in a container that would definitely fit one! If someone can add one before we get a chance to go back, please do. BYOP

Getting too close to the actual house is unnecessary.  There is a second way to reach the cache also. Both ways have plenty of parking. 

The reason we ranked the difficulty and terrain as a 3/3 is due to eery feeling of the nearby area, and that it's VERY difficult at night.

For people that say the difficulty and terrain should be lower, try going at night and see if you think it should be graded lower. :)

Respect the area!</groundspeak:long_description>
