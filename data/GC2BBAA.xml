      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A micro hidden in a shopping area. I wonder where it could be? Don't lift the skirt - that is the domain of the little stingers.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">What can I say. I was here with spoydette replacing one cache and placing another. I had this micro container in the bag and all ready to go. Why not make it a hat trick and place a third. Don't let the fact that there are a number of typical locations for a hide like this stop you from looking.

The name refers to the former tenants of the nearby retail location and their ultimate demise. (I sense a series coming on)

You should be able to drive right up next to this hide. There shouldn't be any trouble with muggles - at least for now. Don't forget to re-hide as found - we don't want to make it too easy.</groundspeak:long_description>
