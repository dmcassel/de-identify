      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is located underneath the bridge over a small creek on the Haverford nature trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">It's a clear plastic container with a blue cap. Inside is a logbook, some string, and some word beads.

Instructions:
Take some string from the canister
Put whatever word beads you like on the string
Tie the string of beads around the yarn on the tree nearby

About 20 feet to the right is a tree with some yarn around it; it should be fairly obvious.

Enjoy the nature trail!

UPDATE 5/28: I'm bringing up some more string and beads on Saturday, June 6. I'm pretty sure I have some more word beads at home, although they might be letter beads; I'll dig around some. If anyone would like to chip in and put some beads and/or string in the cache, by all means feel free to do so. The Ardmore art supply store has a kit with word beads, and regular old plastic beads work as well.</groundspeak:long_description>
