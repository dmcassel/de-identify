These caches will take you to some of the most beautiful views of Bermuda from up above looking down.

Church Bay Bermuda, located in Southampton parish, has always been one of our great favorites of all the beaches that are excellent for snorkeling.

This is a little cove formed by coral cliffs at the western end of the south-shore beaches.


We would take bus #7 to reach the Church bay beach park. The beach park is at the top of a small hill. A steep road from the park leads down to this wonderful beach.</groundspeak:long_description>
