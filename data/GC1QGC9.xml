      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A small cache at the Maryland House Rest Stop in Harford County, MD.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is version 3 of the fifth in a series of caches at the Maryland House Rest Stop, and it was the first micro of the five.  Version 1 got muggled in Sep 2009.  Version 2 disappeared in May 2010.  So, Version 3 is now out, and I have upgraded its size to a small cache.  The previous four caches are in the woods in this paradise between the lanes of I-95.  It is located a little further away from muggle infested areas--hopefully it will last longer as a result.  If you have previously found Versions 1 and 2, your are welcomed to register a find with Version 3.

UPDATE (14 Sep 2009):  You do not have to take anything apart to find the cache.

UPDATE (26 Sep 2009):  Version 1 of this cache disappeared, so now Version 2 is up and running.  Version 2 is located a short distant from the location of Version 1.  Since this is a new container and location, anyone who found Version 1 is welcomed to come look for Version 2 and log in a new find.

UPDATE (5 Jul 2010):  Version 3 is up and running.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>(1) There is a fairly easy way past the holly leaves to get at the cache.
