      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A small size cache located at the Maryland House Rest Stop on I-95, just north of Exit 80 (Belcamp, MD)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The other Maryland House cache (GC19M0Z) has been doing alot of business since it was placed in February 2008--112 logged finds in 4 months time.  So, of course to help handle the extra business, a second cache is needed.

The second cache is located at the north end of the rest area.  The woods here are a little thicker than what is found around Maryland House I.  The parking area near the cache is accessible to both north and south bound traffic.

Please do not park on I-95 to get to this cache. There is plenty of parking at the rest area, and it is only a short walk. There is a path that gets you some of the way to the cache.  Bushwhacking will be required for the rest of the journey.  

During the summer months, briers and ticks will be a problem.

The cache is smaller than Maryland House I.  It can handle small TBs and geocoins.  This cache should be a little more of a challenge than Maryland House I.

MN Chillin' TB27MKK is in the cache for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>
