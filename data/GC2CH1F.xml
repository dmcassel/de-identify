Same location - New Coordinates. Thanks to everyone for the heads-up on the old one.

The second in a series of 18th century caches in Chester County. You seek a camo'd lock-in-lock box with colonial/18th century items located about 15 yards from the famous Zook house built c.1750. The house is located on the Exton Mall property. Amazing piece of history that you've probably passed 100 times without noticing. There is a parking lot close to the cache/next to the house. If trading please try to keep with the theme of colonial/18th century items.</groundspeak:long_description>
