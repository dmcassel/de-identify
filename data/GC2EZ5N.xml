      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache is hidden in the MARC commuter lot of Laurel, MD. The
difficulty level could vary, depending on muggles. Parking is
available, but will be very limited depending on the time you
choose to do your search.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You will be searching for a magnetic cache with room for a log
only. Bring your own writing utensil. Please replace
carefully!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Logging Etiquette: Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great
deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to
hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of
the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have
a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other
finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding
the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.
&lt;strong&gt;Please also keep in mind that the owner needs to know if
the cache is missing. Without DNF logs, the cache owner will not
know they need to check on the cache.&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
