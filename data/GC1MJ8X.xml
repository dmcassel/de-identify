      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A small Lock-n-Lock hidden somewhere between LGL #7 and LGL #8. Not
far off the trail and not way up in the rocks. There is no need to
climb anything.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;One winter day, three GeoGirls (SquirtGunn, deb3day and LNUGE )
were hiking along the old Low Grade line near the Trestle Bridge in
Downingtown. After finding LGL #8 they were making their way west
to find LGL #7. Suddenly, in the far distance they saw a group of
guys in the middle of the trail &amp;ndash; they weren&amp;rsquo;t moving
towards the GeoGirls, they weren&amp;rsquo;t moving away from the
GeoGirls, in fact, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be moving at all!&lt;/p&gt;
The GeoGirls trudged on because, I mean, ya know &amp;ndash; there was
a Geocache just past that gang! As they got closer, the girls
speculated on what this group of young men could be up to and the
consensus was: NO GOOD! But the GeoGirls had two dogs with them and
LNUGE was carrying her trusty &amp;ldquo;walking stick/monopod/geocache
poking stick&amp;rdquo; (that had a pointy end that could serve as an
effective weapon if needed) and of course &amp;hellip;.. there was a
Geocache just past those guys!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the GeoGirls trudged on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The closer they got, the more disturbing the scene became. One guy
had a huge red splatter on his back, another was hooded in burlap
and yet another was wrapped in bloody gauze! There were weapons in
hands and red stains in the snow!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eek, Yuk, Eww, what were the GeoGirls to do?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forge on, of course&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; There was still the matter of
that Geocache &amp;ndash; Ya know!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The geodogs lunged ahead &amp;hellip; but they were not barking and
snarling as faithful pooches should &amp;hellip;. They were sniffing
and licking! They were attracted to the corn syrup based
&amp;ldquo;Bottle O&amp;rsquo; Blood&amp;rdquo; !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GeoGirls then noticed the tripod with the movie camera mounted
on top! You could have heard the trio of exhales from Woodsy
Owl&amp;rsquo;s perch! &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; Just a few teens making a
homemade movie! A great bunch of guys doing stuff other than
getting into trouble. After a photo op with the guys it was no
problem for the GeoGirls to hike on past to the owl's perch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo &amp;hellip; on the way back to their cars, the GeoGirls
placed a cache to commemorate their encounter with "The Demon
Slayers!"&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Looked for about 30 minutes, but no luck. I saw some likely places, but a few of them were not safe climbs -- maybe it was just the leaves, but with a 2.5 terrain rating, I figured that I must be looking in the wrong place. Well, maybe another time.</groundspeak:text>
