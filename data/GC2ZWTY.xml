      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is slightly smaller than the micro size of a film canister.  The GZ is a small turnaround area located in Eagleview just before entering Eagle from 100.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is not turnpike accessible unless you use exit 312 and take 100 N.  Bring your own writing utensil as the cache is only large enough for a log.  

Gave this one a difficulty of two only because you may often find that there can be many muggles around if you cache it at the wrong time.</groundspeak:long_description>
