      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in the Carpenter Area of White Clay Creek
State Park, that is reached from Rt 896. From March to November
this is a fee area-$3 for instate cars, $6 for out of state cars.
(Better yet get an annual pass to all the Delaware State parks for
$27)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 It is being released at the same time as a geocaching event in the
park hosted by &lt;b&gt;WhiteClayLover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The initial cache was located in a high muggle area that is a
fun place to go to. The rock outcropping was used to quarry
millstones. You can see a partly made milstone that was abandoned
at the cache site. There are some large steep rock so caution is
required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPS was jumping lots, but the name should clue you in on
where to look. It is a large size plastic coffee container that has
camo paint. Please keep it well hidden since this area gets a lot
of activity&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The is replacement cache that perviously was named "HIGH ATOP
MILLSTONE MOUNTAIN", but muggles were too much of a problem at that
location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a letterbox about 20 paces back from the summit of
Millstone Mt. if you want another challange&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
