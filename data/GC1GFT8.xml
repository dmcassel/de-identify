      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In 2008, the NY Giants pulled off an amazing Super Bowl victory.  Not only did they have a LONG UPHILL battle, but the UNDER dogs really STICKed it to the Pats in an unbelievable victory.  Just when the Pats thought they were out of the WOODS, the G-menâ€™s quarterback finished an 83-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown pass to seal the deal.  Sorry Eagles fans, but I am a Giants fan in Philly!!</groundspeak:long_description>
