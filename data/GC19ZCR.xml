      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A regular cache located off the Uwchlan Trail near the Jones Pond
Pavilion.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The first caches we found were along the Struble and Uwchlan
Trails, and these remain our favorite types. So when it came time
to hide our first cache, we had to try to keep up with the hides
around the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uwchlan Trail originates at the Struble Trail and wanders
along Shamona Creek adjacent to Dowlin Forge Road. There are
several parking areas along the two trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Pond is a small park located on Dowlin Forge Road. It has
a pavilion and a gazebo, both of which have benches overlooking
Jones Pond. The park is open dawn to dusk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a lock-and-lock type box located within 100 feet of
the trail. The cache is placed with permission by &lt;a href=
"http://www.uwchlan.com"&gt;Uwchlan Township&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
