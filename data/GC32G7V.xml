bushwhacking needed. There is a suggested entrance to the bushes to

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An Ammo Can placed just off the Struble trail in an area that my
father walks daily. This large cache is Child and Adult friendly
with something for everyone. The cache will start with a large
collection of toys and other swag. There is a FTF bag for an Adult
(over 12) with a Patch, Pin and Cache container. There is FTF bag
specifically for a child under age 12, with a hat, patch, pin and
small swag. There will be various Travel Bugs starting their
journeys here. If you take a GeoCoin or Travel Tag, please log it
properly. Special Army National Guard Traveling GeoCoin is one of
the Travel Bugs. All Travel Bugs, Log and Pencil are in a Ziploc
Bag. Please rehide as well or better.&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to tjs305 for FTF Adult.
