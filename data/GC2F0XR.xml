      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is is a nice little building located at the corner of Rt.252 and Goshen Road. I passed this place very often and never stopped. One day I stopped at the parking area nearby to see if I can place a cache here.

As it doesn't make sense to repeat already existing information about this historic place, go to the following link for more information.

You can start a short walk (about 1 mile) before or after visiting this place.

The cache is perhaps not so easy to reach for everybody even if you can see the hide already. It's not in one of the bird boxes.
