      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I admit that it's weird to place one of my "reality" caches in such an UNREAL place, but it's not like that...See, the past few days I've been picking up one of the workers from inside the building because he is temporarily carless. Think when you are here of all of the hard labor that goes into our fun. The Mirage you see around you is created on the backs of the worker bees. Take a moment in the windy peace to pay homage to those members of the proletariat. That's why I planted this (what I'm sure will be VERY) temporary cache. Thank you for your support!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
