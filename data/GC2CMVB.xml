      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Our friend, Kin9sPank, the self proclaimed “Kin9 of Geocaching and Member of the Chester County Caching Royalty” has been claiming authority over these lands since 11/2002. After a recent VICTORY event, he posted the following log:</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">“I am declaring a moratorium on all caches less than two miles from the home coordinates. I just want to take the rest of the summer off of doing nearby caches.”

Lucky us!!! We found the THRONE!

Please obey all rules for this park.
