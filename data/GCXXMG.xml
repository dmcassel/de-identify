      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache location is a maritime classic from the Chesapeake Bay that used to light the entrance to the Baltimore Harbor.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The lighthouse was saved from demolition in 1988 and instead moved to the Inner Harbor as a tourist attraction of Baltimore maritime history.  The area around it has recently been developed as an upscale retail area and promenade. It is helping to push out the edge of the Inner Harbor redevelopment.

In all cases, watch out for Muggles. There is no admission to do this cache!!  Replace as found please. Small items might fit.  A fingernail is required to access cache contents.

This is part of our Downtown Baltimore series of caches.</groundspeak:long_description>
