      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The serfs begin their proclamation with an admonition. May this tiny hide insure all who enter the Kin9dom do so with the full understanding of the proceedings of both flanks of the local nobility, and the extent of their consequence.</groundspeak:short_description>
