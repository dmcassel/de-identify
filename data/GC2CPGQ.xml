      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A short, simple two stage multi-cache to bring you to the oasis.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This area was just begging to have a cache (or caches) placed here. A  prototypical wild oasis. A forest, meadows and ponds wedged between highways, roads, and commercial and retail buildings.

Stage 1 is a micro containing just the coordinates for stage 2. Stage 2 is a large small or a small regular depending on how you look at it.

I hope you enjoy your time here.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[Stage 1:] Film canister in rocks
[Stage 2: Should be obvious, I'll add a hint if people can't find it.]
