The Whitford Lodge was built c. 1782 by one of the first descendents of West Whiteland Township. Richard Thomas was nicknamed the "fighting Quaker" for his role as Colonel of the 1st regiment of Chester County Volunteers during the War for Independence. The brick Georgian style mansion is one of a few still standing in this area. The Whitford Hall and the Whitford Hall Tenant House are attached and built c.1796. Great buildings.</groundspeak:long_description>
