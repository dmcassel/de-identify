      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This was known as Bonds' factory as early as 1847. The mill
operated for 110 years, along Beaver Creek, making everything from
woolens in 1841 to linings for U.S. Air Force jackets during WW11.
At some point clusters of houses were built and named
Bondsville,after the mill owner. It closed permanently in 1954.
Since then the buildings have fallen victim to the weather. A
memorial was erected to commemerate the factory workers who served
in WW11. Be sure to look through the gate to see the mill. Film
cannister with log,pencil and a few tree+-deer confetti.
