      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was placed in honor of the completion of Dave's Boy Scout "Eagle Project".  Congrats!  It's a short walk along a paved trail to the cache site.  Parking is available at N 40d 07.274 S 075d 33.209.  Remember, it's a micro with no writing implement so BYOP, and as always...."Be Prepared".

02/21/11:  I have just been informed that there is a lock and lock box very near to our micro cache.  After a bit of research, I have discovered that the box is, in fact, a letterbox not a geocache.  If you find that, don't log it as a find for Dave'sDoin's.  The cache is close by, but it is a micro with it's own log.  A bit trickier to find.</groundspeak:long_description>
