      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Located at a small community park outside of Oxford.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located at the Oxford Area Regional Park.  The sewage treatment plant is nearby, hence the name (with a nod to Ghostbusters).  This is a fairly new park just begging for a cache to be placed here.  A typical cache hide, this should be an easy find for experienced and novice cachers alike. Making the find may be difficult at times - you'll see why when you get there.  As always, use stealth when needed.   Park is open from dawn to dusk.

A hint will be provided if DNFs start to pile up.

This cache is NOT accessible from the Rt. 1 bypass!  Use the Rt. 472 exit and navigate off road from there.  It appears that auto navigation won't be much good - it'll do it's best to put you on the bypass.

I've added a link to the Oxford Recreation website so that you can see the future plans they have for this area.

Congrats to $hunter for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
