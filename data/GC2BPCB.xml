      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Coraline is a tiny kitten who had an unfortunate encounter with an automobile when she was too young to be away from mama.  After being rescued by a witness and taken to the SPCA, she ended up in the hands of an angel at this location.  With months of TLC from the whole staff, Coraline grew into a strong, soft, crazy, adorable cat who ended up becoming part of our family.  This, our first cache, is in honor of Dr. S. and her staff, our amazing friends who saved our Coraline.

Note: please do NOT dig in the flowerpots!  The cache is not in the flowers or dirt!!

Placed outside with permission of the establishment; I think we even convinced two of them to join us in geocaching!  But don't ask for hints; they can't help you.

FTF is a unactivated Geocache FTF coin. Congrats to bpp_picnic for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
