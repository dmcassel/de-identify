Easily accessible. Just off of Rte 78 in Clinton. The 1.5 terrain rating is because this is not wheelchair accessible.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">WALLY IS BACK IN BUSINESS. Possibly the victim of landscaping maintenance -Wally has been replaced in a manner that will prevent this type of horrible accident in the future.
This is the 6th in a Series of easy micro hides that are designed to provide a quick geocache fix. These micros can be found at lunchtime, a quick stop on the way home from work, running out on a weekend errand - just about any reason to get out of the house. This is a quick, easy way to squeeze in a find. The cache contains a log and a pencil, but you may want to bring your own writing instrument just in case.  ENJOY!</groundspeak:long_description>
