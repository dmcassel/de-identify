      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Micro cache hidden on a small bridge that we spotted while on a visit to the US. The bridges' Engineer was N.R.Rambo, hence the name. Take your time looking around for the cache and watch for muggles. Parking available right near the bridge.

As we are not natives to this continent, the "Pirates of Penn" will be maintaining the cache for us. Please contact them if there are any issues.</groundspeak:long_description>
