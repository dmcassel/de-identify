When the girls were little, we liked to use code to talk about things we didn't want them to know about. They quickly learned that when Mom and Dad were considering a stop at the "red lemon" they would be very happy!  We still enjoy our traditional visit to the "red lemon" once in a while... especially on a warm summer evening.  
 
Enjoy a snack at the "red lemon" or post a letter during the day, there's plenty to do here.
 
FTF is a gold dollar.  Congrats to deb3day for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
