      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is located near the Uwchlan Trail near the intersection
with the Struble Trail. One place to park is in the lot at the
corner of Dowlin Forge and Shelmire Roads. Uwchlan is Welsh for
'upper land' and is pronounced you-clen (with the emphasis on the
first syllable).</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is an ammo box that contains a variety of trinkets. 
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to leave time to visit the partially restored mill
(near the Uwchlan Trail) and forge (near the Struble Trail), both
of which are within 1/2 mile of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White tail deer populations are managed on Chester County Real
Estate consistent with current seasons, bag limits and objectives
by the Pennsylvania Game Commission. Hunting on County Real Estate
is an effort to scientifically manage wildlife populations within
the park system, while preserving a balanced ecosystem while
providing ongoing viewing opportunities for the general public. All
Department authorized hunters will have a Park-issued hunting
permit displayed. It is highly recommended that Geocachers wear
orange during all Pennsylvania Game Commission hunting seasons,
especially deer seasons. PA Game Commission Orange Rules may be
found at
http://www.pgc.state.pa.us/pgc/lib/pgc/digestpdfs/2004/orange_rules.pdf.&lt;/p&gt;
