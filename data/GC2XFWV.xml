      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Decided to hide one on the Poughkeepsie side of the Walkway Bridge near the parking.  You should enjoy a walk on Bridge after finding this one. Small bison tube.  BYOP! Park in either parking area but one charges $5 to park. Weekdays are better and in the morning time.  Cloudy days are even better. Beware of muggles!</groundspeak:short_description>
