      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A small Lock-n-lock in the neighborhood of two banks.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A theme style Lock-n-lock with international and other coins. The coins are in a bag to make it easy to open the cache. If you donâ€™t have such a coin, no need to leave something. Feel free to take a coin ( not the whole bag Please).
Since Muggle activity can be high, you might want to take the cache to your car to open and explore. Return cache to location and camo lightly please.
