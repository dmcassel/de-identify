Well they make a new road of course. Good thing for us because
these sites make great Geo hide locations. Here is one of them that
even the kids can do but you still have to be careful because of
the main road only a couple of yards away. This one is magnetic but
does not look magnetic. If you drive to the end of the cal de sac
you have a good view of I-95.</groundspeak:long_description>
