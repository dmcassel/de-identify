      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This should be a fairly easy park and grab located in Charles Town Square. If your looking for a long hike or some bushwacking you should pass on this cache :)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I'm going to say that this is a micro. There is no room to trade any items at all and you Must bring your own Pen, a pencil will not do! PLEASE REMEMBER THE EXACT SPOT YOU FOUND THIS CACHE AND RETURN IT TO THAT SPOT PLEASE. I've stopped by to check a few times and always seem to find it in the wrong spot. Thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>
