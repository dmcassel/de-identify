      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Lloyd park on Lloyd Avenue is the best off-leash public dog park we have ever found. Beautiful area with lots of grass to run and a river to play in with other dogs. Plenty of parking on Lloyd Avenue.

Zoe our pup loves coming to this park to play with all her friends, so we thought we would place a cache here so others can come and enjoy this great little area. Stealth is a must as there is usually lots of muggles and their dogs.

This cache is a micro so please replace exactly as found.

Also if you bring your dog please follow all off-leash park rules.

Enjoy!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
