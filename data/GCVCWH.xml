      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Located on the outskirts of beautiful downtown Downingtown PA this
is one of those things you see but never stop to listen to....</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is a micro and at the time of placement did have a stubby pencil
with the log. You might want to bring your own writing implement
just in case. IT IS NOT ON THE LANDMARK THAT TOWERS OVER THIS
AREA!!! Located near the "singing" bridge along route 322 on the
westbound side. Plenty of safe railing and no need to cross the
road to access.
