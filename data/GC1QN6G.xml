      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You have probably noticed this location as you have driven past on Ohio SR315.  I knew I needed to place a cache here and it took a bit.  The cache has been placed with permission from the owners of the memorial.  As always be respectful of the location and take some time and look around.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Took me a few minutes to find it, but I got my first OH cache while on a business trip from PA. Thanks for bringing me to the spot. 

Log is very wet. I laid it out for a few minutes but it needs more. </groundspeak:text>
