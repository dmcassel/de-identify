Too!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an urban micro that has been hidden in a unique way.
South Jersey locals repeatedly tell stories about Mrs. Leeds and
her 13th child...the infamous Jersey Devil! For those of you who
are not familiar with the story, the most popular legend
follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The story begins in 1735 when a Mrs. Leeds of Smithville was
pregnant. This was to be her thirteenth child, and Mrs. Leeds was
feeling old before her time. As her labor began one stormy night,
she cursed the unborn baby during a fit of painful contractions,
saying, "Let this child be a devil!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mrs. Leeds soon forgot her curse when a beautiful baby boy
was placed in her arms by the midwife. Suddenly the baby's body
started to mutate, and Mrs. Leeds watched in horror as the baby's
face elongated to resemble a bat or horse, and long, dark wings
sprouted from his shoulder blades. His legs grew long and thin and
his pudgy feet hardened and formed into hoof-like extremities. Fear
gripped all in the room as long claws grew from the baby's
fingertips and his blue eyes yellowed. The creature before them now
showed no resemblance to the baby it had been just moments before
its transformation. The beast let out an ear-piercing scream and
then turned, burst through the roof of the cabin and flew off into
the night...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache happens to be located between 665 and 667 McKendimen
Rd (on the opposite side)...you do the math!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has an easy approach on city streets. No 4x4 is needed. Be
sure to replace it &lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt; as you found it. We pray you
enjoy this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a pen or pencil to sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE&lt;/u&gt;, No spoiler photographs or logs (even if
encrypted). It detracts from our intentions for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This cache has been redone as a tribute to FlyinV, who placed
the original cache "The (Jersey) Devil Made Us Do It" back in
January 2005.&amp;nbsp; That cache is now archived, but we loved the
cleverness of this cache so we resurrected it with their
blessing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
