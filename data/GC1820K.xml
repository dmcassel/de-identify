      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">My Gordon Setter Drake is my constant companion on caching runs. Since we have been traveling between Downingtown and Ephrata a few times lately, we decided it was time to place a cache along 322 to help others with kids and dogs that might enjoy a little leg stretch along the way.
This is an ammo can painted brown. It should be a pretty easy find!</groundspeak:long_description>
