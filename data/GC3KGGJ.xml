      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is my second cache. It's a quick one, use caution for muggles, and when you are done stop by the bakery and grab a cupcake. They are amazing! It's is just feet off a paved sidewalk and could be seen from the sidewalk! Have fun searching and after this one and the cupcake, take a nice walk to Berwyn Memorial to get another cache! BYOP. Can hold small items. </groundspeak:long_description>
