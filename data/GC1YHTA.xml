target="_blank"&gt;Delaware Geocaching Trail&lt;/a&gt; will take you on an
adventurous journey throughout the great State of Delaware. Our
trail will excite you with all of the historical and cultural
treasures hidden in Delawareâ€™s three counties. As you proceed on
your venture, you will witness the beautiful estates, gardens and
sanctuaries that envelope this great state. You will admire the
early 1800s architecture of the churches and homes in New Castle
County. You will learn about the early Indian tribes that settled
along the rivers and bays in Sussex County. While exploring Kent
County, you will also be in touch with the defenders of our State
and country.
