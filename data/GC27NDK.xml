      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a micro cache as it only contains a log, so please be sure to bring your own pen.  

Cache is readily accessible, but the area might be subject to muggles, especially on the weekends, so be sure to be stealth!

The cache is specifically placed and positioned -- please return it as found.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is the first cache hidden by the RhombusRovers, and we are excited to venture into this aspect of Geocaching - the cache is homemade, but designed with this particular spot and scenario in mind.

Update 5/2/10 -- based on initial feedback via log postings, we have placed the log in a tiny zip-lock bag, and placed that within the cache.  It is a snug fit, but with care should be easily removed and replaced.  Hopefully this will keep the log dry.

Congratulations to donbaker13 for being FTF -- within hours of the cache being published!</groundspeak:long_description>
