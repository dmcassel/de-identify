      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Simple grab- just gotta find it.  This is findable in the snow and is a 24/7 cache.  It is in an office park right off Rt 7.  Nothing too special.  

There is parking in the cul de sac nearby.  You can take the sidewalk down the hill to Raglan Park for a nice walk in some woods.  Walk up the hill to watch the construction of the Metro.

I confess to placing this cache to assist 366 day streakers keep going should there be snow.</groundspeak:long_description>
