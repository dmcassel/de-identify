      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">"Hideaway" is not a good clue, because if a cache was never hidden away, this is it! I've provided a small "tool" to help retrieve the log. Please replace the cache as found, and make sure it's secure. BYOP, there's room for the log only, and a small FTF prize.
Log a DNF and I'll email a clue.

Congrats to bearette &amp; Bear3 for the FTF! [:D]</groundspeak:long_description>
