      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is located in a local park complete with a playground, basketball and tennis courts. Should be an easy find for first-timers and those with small children.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a micro-cache (35mm film canister). Its location should be fairly obvious once in the general area though there are a bunch of nooks where it might be stashed.

The cache is NOT big enough to hold any items other than its log scroll and small pencil.

Congrats to Woofiegrrl on the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
