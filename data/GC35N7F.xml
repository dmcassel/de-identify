      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Not your typical bison tube in a pine tree.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The concept worked on paper. We'll see if it works for real. Look
carefully and you should be able to figure it out. Stealth needed
to get started. Pay attention to what you are doing so you can
re-hide the container the same way. FTF gets a FTF pin and your own
cache container to hide. Contains log, pencil and small swag.&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to JeepFeet for FTF.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
