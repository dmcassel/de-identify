NEW CONTAINER, NEW LOCATION Sept 12, 2010</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is now a small nalgene bottle with small wacky trade
items (nuts and bolts, odd hardware). The park has been extensively
landscaped and improved since I placed my first geocache hide here.
The giant tree on the knoll also toppled during a storm earlier
this summer, and further changed the hiding area. Tucked away in an
igneous spot. Three trails lead to the park from the coordinates
given below. The park is surrounded by houses, and closes at dark.
Please limit searches to daylight times and be discrete if children
are using the playground. Access is from paved trails at:
&lt;p&gt;1. 38 51 39.86 w 77 10 22.14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. 38 51 45.75 w 77 10 21.73&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. 38 51 44.34 w 77 10 16.57&lt;/p&gt;

NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter
the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you
can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching
in the parks in jeopardy.&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
