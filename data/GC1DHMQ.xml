      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A few steps at the trail head, hard packed gravel path from there.  A few small ups and downs nothing bad.  About 5-10 feet of off trail, grass could hide a snake or ticks, just a warning.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A beautiful walk around a vineyard.  Along the way there is a gazebo, picnic tables and several places to take great pictures.  ENJOY!

BYOP, Room for small TBs and geocoins as well as other small trading items.

**Big Thanks to Binky Del Mar, she is monitoring/sponsoring this cache.**</groundspeak:long_description>
