      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Access to this cache area is easy to find. It is along the Struble
Trail but is NOT on county property. NOTE: There is a Letterbox
nearby. Make sure you have found the cache not the box for credit.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Be assured that the property from the middle of the trail and up
the hillside belongs to my family. Starting at the big jutting rock
and past the chain link fence heading towards Downingtown. Enjoy
this cache along the quietest part of the Struble Trail. Plenty of
places to fish and skp rocks. The cache area is great for people
watching. Placed on private property along the Struble Trail this
is Tupperware box with a log, pencil and some things of our
favorite character and normal cache stuff. It was given a 2 for
thick foliage cover and plenty of places to hide and a little
climb. The cache is less than 50' from the Struble trail so you do
not need to climb to the top searching. Please respect the private
property and don't try to climb to the top.
