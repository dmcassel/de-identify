      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was hidden with the permission of the owner of the facility. You do not need to climb anything at all! The cache is easily reachable from standing Right in front of the memorial. It is not in the bricks so please do not remove any!

This is at a place that has some local history that not many people know about. Most of the people that come here every day, don't even notice this memorial. On weekends there will be many muggles, so please be careful. Please NO TRACKABLES! I don't want them going missing!

This is a very sensitive cache so please make sure you take the few minutes to rehide properly or it will be muggled. Look at it as if you were hiding your own cache and didn't want anyone to find it.

Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>
