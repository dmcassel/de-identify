      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Easy path for most of the journey, about a 1/4 mile hike.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in a sports park, it is hidden back into a wooded area.  Nice trails, but trailheads are not marked well.  Enjoy the journey!  GPS was a little erratic due to heavy fog/cloud cover ... but let it average for 15 minutes and it should be close.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>A fallen dead tree, is the hiding place for me.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Bit of a hot day for this one, but I persisted past the bugs and spider webs big enough to endanger small children and came away with the smiley while passing through the area. I was glad I had some water with me.
