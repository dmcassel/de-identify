      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">At last, for those who have been waiting, another winery cache.  Ammo box hidden on winery grounds.  Placed with permission of the owners.  Please hide as you found it.</groundspeak:short_description>

There are over 100 wineries in Pennsylvania with new ones opening often.  This is one of the newest PA wineries and is located in a beautiful spot in Southwestern Chester County.  

Being WNELVRS, weâ€™ve merged our two favorite hobbies, geocaching and visiting wineries (and tasting), into a delightful experience. By placing caches at wineries, we hope others will discover the beauty of the wineries and surrounding countryside, and if so inclined, experience the wonderful variety of wines grown and made in Pennsylvania.</groundspeak:long_description>
